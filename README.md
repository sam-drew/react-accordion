# React Accordion Function Component

- Accordion is a function component that takes both `data` (an array of `AccordionDataItem` typed objects) and `multipleOpen` (a boolean) as props.

- Uses the `useEffect` hook to manage rerendering correctly when the `multipleOpen` option is toggled.

- Uses the `useState` hook to manage state in the function components.
